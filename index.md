I'm a linguist based at [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk), where I coordinate the [PPLS Skills Centre](https://skillscentre.ppls.ed.ac.uk).  That's also where I finished my PhD in Linguistics and English Language under the supervision of [Prof Geoffrey K Pullum](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~gpullum/) and [Prof Nikolas Gisborne](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/nikolas-gisborne).
